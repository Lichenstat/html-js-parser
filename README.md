# html-js-parser
An attempt to make a html to js string parser for changing and modifying html purely using js through strings and mostly regular expressions.

Partially working.
At the moment it starts breaking down and having issues with longer html strings.
Also has issues when attempting to parse many symbols within a given string (sometimes regexp and symbols don't play nice).
Limited functionality at the moment.
